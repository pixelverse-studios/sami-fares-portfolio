This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files, combined into a single document by Repomix.

================================================================
File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: src/app/page.tsx, src/components/home/FeaturedWorks.tsx, src/components/home/AboutMe.tsx, src/components/home/HomeHero.tsx
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

          <p>
            I’ve always been a creative, and my path to design started in music.
            Writing and producing for recording artists taught me how to
            brainstorm, collaborate, and turn ideas into something people could
            connect with. Music showed me how to create for people—and that’s
            what drew me to UX as well: the idea that creativity can shape
            experiences people actually enjoy and use. Transitioning into design
            felt like a natural extension of the work I was already doing. Now,
            I bring that same mindset to every project: thoughtful, hands-on,
            and focused on creating something that truly works for the people
            using it—because like the music, it was made for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not designing, you can probably find me outside fishing—a
            hobby that gets me away from screens and helps clear my mind.
