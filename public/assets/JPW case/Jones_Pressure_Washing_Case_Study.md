## Case Study: Jones Pressure Washing - New Local Business with No Credibility

### 0.0 Problem Framing - New Local Business with No Credibility

Jones Pressure Washing was a brand-new company entering the competitive home services market in New Jersey. With no website, reviews, or digital footprint, they faced a major challenge: earning trust from customers who rely on online credibility to make quick decisions.

The client needed more than a basic website—they needed a professional, trustworthy brand presence that could stand out locally and convert visitors into leads. The design had to clearly communicate services, professionalism, and local relevance, while remaining simple enough to manage for a small team.

At its core, this project was about crafting legitimacy from scratch in an industry where visual trust, clarity, and local SEO directly impact business growth.

### 0.1 Project Overview

Jones Pressure Washing is a residential and commercial soft washing company based in New Jersey. At the start of the project, they had a basic one-page site that lacked clear structure, hierarchy, or branding. Their goal was to elevate their digital presence with a professional website that could build trust, attract local leads, and support long-term growth.

I led the UX strategy, responsive design, content planning, and SEO foundation. I collaborated closely with a developer to ensure every custom-coded component was implemented as designed. The result is a clean, mobile-first experience built to establish credibility and drive conversions — even without existing reviews or a visual portfolio.

### 0.2 Project Goals & Challenges

With no content, brand identity, or online credibility in place, Jones Pressure Washing needed more than a visual facelift — they needed a foundation. Rather than rehash the limitations, I focused on building a site that could earn trust quickly through clarity, visual professionalism, and strong local signals. The challenge wasn’t just to make something look good — it was to design a conversion engine for a brand without a track record.

**Client Goals**  
- Establish a professional and trustworthy digital presence  
- Generate leads through clear, action-oriented CTAs  
- Clearly explain core services to first-time visitors  
- Rank well for local search terms in New Jersey

**Constraints**  
- No brand identity, portfolio, or testimonials  
- Limited visual assets or pre-written content  
- Highly competitive local market  
- Tight timeline: 6 weeks from start to launch

### 0.3 Research & Discovery

I conducted a competitive review of pressure washing businesses across Northern New Jersey, analyzing how they structured content, implemented SEO, and approached layout across desktop and mobile. I also read through Google and Yelp reviews to understand what customers cared about most — from communication and pricing to before-and-after results.

Because the client lacked testimonials and a visual portfolio, I explored how to build trust without traditional social proof. I supplemented my research by speaking with homeowners in my network to better understand how they choose service providers. These informal conversations revealed a strong reliance on first impressions, location visibility, and quick clarity about services and pricing.

**Key Research Takeaways**  
- Sites must establish trust within the first few seconds of landing  
- Services should be broken down into short, scannable chunks  
- Local SEO (county and town names) plays a major role in discovery  
- Mobile-first layouts are critical for on-the-go, last-minute searches  
- CTAs should appear early and often — users shouldn’t have to search for ways to take action

### 0.4 UX Strategy & Design Decisions

Instead of starting with wireframes, I moved directly into high-fidelity mockups based on competitive analysis and a content-first strategy. I used Figma to iterate layout ideas quickly, incorporating client feedback while applying UX best practices in hierarchy, spacing, and call-to-action design.

With no branding in place, I focused on structure, copy clarity, and visual trust signals to create a site that felt professional and conversion-ready. Every decision was grounded in one core objective: to build immediate credibility and make it easy for users to take action.

**Design Highlights**  
- Above-the-Fold CTAs: “Request Your Free Estimate” appears prominently on the homepage and is repeated throughout the site to reduce friction and drive leads  
- Premium Aesthetic: A black, white, and gold palette was chosen to convey a high-end feel, matching the client’s vision of an “elite” pressure washing brand  
- SEO-Informed Copy: Each service section included relevant keywords and H1/H2 structure to support local search optimization and improve findability  
- Service Architecture: Services were grouped into skimmable content blocks with links to dedicated pages, supporting both UX clarity and SEO indexing  
- Mobile Optimization: Tap targets were enlarged, content was vertically stacked, and the layout prioritized on-the-go usability to align with mobile-first browsing behavior  
- Local Targeting: Repeated geographic references (counties, towns) helped reinforce location relevance and build authority for local search

### 0.5 Final Designs & Reflections

This project demonstrated how thoughtful UX strategy can establish credibility from the ground up — even for a brand with no content, reviews, or digital footprint. By designing for where the business was headed, not just where it was at launch, I helped the client establish a polished digital presence they could confidently grow into.

Final development is currently in progress. All designs shown reflect approved deliverables, and I’m actively collaborating with the developer to bring them to life.

**Key Achievements**  
- Created a scalable site structure designed to grow with the business  
- Built a clean, professional brand presence from the ground up  
- Delivered a responsive, mobile-first layout with strong conversion intent  
- Designed an SEO-ready architecture with localized content and page structure  
- Developed strategic content in the absence of branding, portfolio, or testimonials

**Lessons Learned**  
- Starting with user needs leads to stronger outcomes than chasing visual trends  
- Content strategy can bridge gaps when visual assets are limited  
- Clear information architecture is essential for service-based websites  
- Local SEO considerations should shape site structure from the beginning  
- Designing for future growth requires conscious, scalable decisions early on
