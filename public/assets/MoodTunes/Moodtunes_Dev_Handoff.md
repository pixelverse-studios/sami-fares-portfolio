## 0.0 Problem Framing – Music That Matches the Moment

Users often feel disconnected from the music recommendations they receive. Traditional streaming algorithms focus on past behavior and general taste — but don’t account for real-time context like mood, energy level, or activity. As a result, users find themselves replaying the same playlists for workouts, focus, or relaxation, and are rarely exposed to new or local artists.

Moodtunes addresses this by letting users select how they feel in the moment and generating playlists that match that energy — while subtly surfacing local artists they might otherwise miss.

## 0.1 Project Overview

**Context:**  
Moodtunes is a conceptual mobile music app designed to improve how users discover playlists that reflect their real-time mood, energy level, or activity. Unlike traditional platforms that rely on taste history or engagement patterns, Moodtunes takes a user-centered approach — letting users guide their listening experience based on how they feel in the moment.

This project was initiated to expand my portfolio beyond client websites and explore the full product design process. I led all UX and UI design, including research, user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity mockups. The app also introduces an additional layer of value by subtly promoting local artists, giving them visibility through emotionally aligned playlists.

Moodtunes allowed me to apply emotional design thinking, mobile-first UX, and product strategy within a realistic scope, while experimenting with new patterns of discovery in the music space.

**My Role:** UX/UI Designer, Copywriter  
**Client:** Conceptual Music App  
**Timeline:** 8 Weeks  
**Tools:** Figma, Web Research, ChatGPT  
**Deliverables:** User Flows, Wireframes, High-Fidelity Mockups

## 0.2 Project Goals & Challenges

The goal behind Moodtunes was to explore how music discovery could shift from algorithm-driven suggestions to real-time emotional curation. I wanted to create an experience that respected how users feel in the moment, not just what they’ve historically liked — while also giving local artists more visibility in a space dominated by mainstream data.

To strengthen emotional alignment, the playlist logic also draws inspiration from how certain frequencies can trigger psychological responses — calming, energizing, or focusing the listener. This helped inform both the tone of the UI and the intent behind curated playlist groupings.

**UX Goals:**
- Create a fast and frictionless flow where users can select their mood and receive music instantly.
- Balance emotional depth with simplicity.
- Build a system that introduces local or lesser-known artists in a non-intrusive way.

**Constraints:**
- No live user testing was conducted.
- Conceptual flows prioritize UX clarity over MVP functionality.

## 0.3 Research & Discovery

To ground the concept in real user needs, I evaluated how current music platforms approach discovery. I reviewed Spotify, Pandora, and SoundCloud, focusing on how they match music to user context.

- **Spotify:** Algorithmic trends, no mood input.  
- **Pandora:** Categorizes by traits, lacks emotional/situational context.  
- **SoundCloud:** Indie-friendly but chaotic browsing.

These gaps revealed a clear opportunity to design a mobile experience that meets users where they are emotionally and mentally.

**Key Research Takeaways:**
- Existing platforms lack contextual awareness.
- Users crave novelty without sacrificing relevance.
- Discovery of local artists is still low.
- Over-personalization leads to repetition.
- Users associate music with tasks/emotions but apps don’t accommodate that well.

## 0.4 UX Strategy & Design Decisions

With a mobile-first approach, the UX goal was to minimize friction and make discovery feel instant, personal, and emotionally relevant. The interface was designed to stay clean and emotionally resonant without overwhelming users.

**Design Highlights:**
- **Mood-Based Input Flow:** Minimized taps to reduce decision fatigue.
- **Emotionally-Aligned UI:** Used calm tones, clean spacing.
- **Local Artist Discovery:** Subtle label tags promote emerging voices.
- **Playlist Logic:** Grouped by sound frequency principles for emotional tone.

## Final Designs & Reflections

Moodtunes was designed to explore product-focused UX beyond marketing sites. The challenge was to create an emotionally intelligent music experience that responded to how users feel in real time.

I handled concept through UI delivery, using research, wireframes, and high-fi mockups. The result: a flow that curates music by mood, energy, and activity — while boosting visibility for local artists.

**Key Achievements:**
- Built full UX flow from onboarding to artist exploration.
- Created high-fidelity mobile mockups.
- Scalable curation system.
- Lightweight discovery UX.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Simplified input = better emotional UX.
- Wireframing complex interactions early saves time later.
- Product case studies reveal richer UX patterns.
- Solo concept work benefits from realistic scoping.
