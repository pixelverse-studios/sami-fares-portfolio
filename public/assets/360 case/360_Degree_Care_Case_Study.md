## Case Study: 360 Degree Care - Building Digital Trust in Home Health

### 0.0 Problem Framing - Creating Digital Trust for a New Care Brand

360 Degree Care was a newly established home health care agency in New Jersey. With no digital presence, they were virtually invisible to families searching online for in-home support. In a highly sensitive industry built on trust, that lack of visibility became a major barrier to growth.

The client needed a professional website that could both inform and reassure their target audience: adults researching care options for aging parents or loved ones. The goal wasnâ€™t just to generate leads â€” it was to build trust at a glance, answer common questions, and help users take that emotionally difficult first step.

The design challenge was to combine emotional clarity with an easy-to-navigate information structure tailored to anxious, time-sensitive users making high-stakes decisions.

### 0.1 Project Overview

360 Degree Care approached me to design and launch their first website. I led the full UX and design process â€” including site architecture, content strategy, and high-fidelity mockups â€” and worked closely with the client to align on structure and flow. While the final visual style reflected strong client preferences, I ensured the user experience remained clear, accessible, and emotionally resonant throughout.

I also collaborated with the developer from the earliest stages to keep implementation aligned with both the design and evolving client input. This helped us stay nimble and avoid rework as decisions shifted.

### 0.2 Project Goals & Challenges

The clientâ€™s primary goal was to establish a digital presence quickly and start building trust with families in need of in-home care. While they had experience in traditional marketing, they were less familiar with the nuances of digital UX and web strategy. The project required thoughtful communication to align user-centered design decisions with a visually driven brand vision.

I focused early efforts on educating the client about effective UX principles â€” including content hierarchy, scannability, and what builds trust for first-time visitors â€” while ensuring the final site honored their preferences and goals.

**Client Goals**  
- Establish legitimacy as a licensed care provider  
- Emphasize dignity and active lifestyles in imagery  
- Explain services clearly and in detail  
- Communicate with transparency and warmth

**Constraints**  
- Limited content available and short timeline  
- Client rejected proposed calming color palette  
- Client insisted on oversized typography for readability  
- Non-standard layout and styling requests

### 0.3 Research & Discovery

I began with a competitive review of the top home care agencies in northern New Jersey, analyzing how they structured their websites, the tone of their messaging, and how effectively they reassured visitors navigating emotionally complex decisions.

To complement that, I also conducted informal discovery through conversations with friends and family members who had recently gone through the process of finding home care. These stories underscored the urgency, emotional strain, and confusion that often accompany these decisions â€” and shaped how I approached tone, structure, and visual hierarchy.

**Key Research Takeaways**  
- Most competitors used calming color palettes and soft, reassuring imagery  
- Sites with clear FAQs and multiple contact options instilled more trust  
- Visitors scanned for key info like insurance accepted, service areas, and 24/7 availability  
- Overly modern or salesy designs felt cold and disconnected from user needs  
- CTAs needed to be visible early and often â€” visitors shouldnâ€™t have to search to reach out

### 0.4 UX Strategy & Design Decisions

Given the emotional nature of the service, I proposed a visual direction that combined calming blue tones with warm, uplifting imagery â€” portraying aging with dignity and vitality. While the client chose a more vibrant palette to stand out from competitors, they embraced the imagery concept fully, and it became a key visual theme across the site.

Throughout the project, I worked to preserve core UX principles: structuring information to reduce cognitive load, emphasizing clarity of message, and ensuring large, tappable areas for mobile users. The goal was to keep the experience reassuring and intuitive, regardless of aesthetic preferences.

**Design Highlights**  
- Emotionally Calibrated Copy: Tone was crafted to feel warm and informative, avoiding jargon while addressing key user concerns  
- Imagery & Tone: Photography featured active, joyful older adults to reinforce dignity, comfort, and optimism  
- Color Palette & Branding: The clientâ€™s preference for vibrant orange was balanced with neutral supporting tones to maintain readability and trust  
- Location Callouts: Local areas were integrated across pages to build geographic authority and support SEO

Despite a tight timeline and strong client-led visual direction, I delivered a responsive, multi-page website that remained grounded in UX principles. The final experience earned positive feedback during early user testing, with clear content structure, emotionally calibrated messaging, and strong local relevance that helped build immediate trust.
