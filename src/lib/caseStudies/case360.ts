  '360 Degree Care was a newly established home health care agency in New Jersey. With no digital presence, they were virtually invisible to families searching online for in-home support. In a highly sensitive industry built on trust, that lack of visibility became a major barrier to growth.',
  'The client needed a professional website that could both inform and reassure their target audience: adults researching care options for aging parents or loved ones. The goal wasn’t just to generate leads — it was to build trust at a glance, answer common questions, and help users take that emotionally difficult first step.',
  'The design challenge was to combine emotional clarity with an easy-to-navigate information structure tailored to anxious, time-sensitive users making high-stakes decisions.'

const projectOverview = {
  context: [
    '360 Degree Care approached me to design and launch their first website. I led the full UX and design process — including site architecture, content strategy, and high-fidelity mockups — and worked closely with the client to align on structure and flow. While the final visual style reflected strong client preferences, I ensured the user experience remained clear, accessible, and emotionally resonant throughout.',
    'I also collaborated with the developer from the earliest stages to keep implementation aligned with both the design and evolving client input. This helped us stay nimble and avoid rework as decisions shifted.'

const goalsAndChallenges = {
  goals: [
    'Establish legitimacy as a licensed care provider',
    'Emphasize dignity and active lifestyles in imagery',
    'Explain services clearly and in detail',
    'Communicate with transparency and warmth'

  challenges: [
    'Limited content available and short timeline',
    'Client insisted on oversized typography for readability',
    'Client rejected proposed calming color palette',
    'Non-standard layout and styling requests'

  description: [
    "The client's primary goal was to establish a digital presence quickly and start building trust with families in need of in-home care. While they had experience in traditional marketing, they were less familiar with the nuances of digital UX and web strategy. The project required thoughtful communication to align user-centered design decisions with a visually driven brand vision.",
    'I focused early efforts on educating the client about effective UX principles — including content hierarchy, scannability, and what builds trust for first-time visitors — while ensuring the final site honored their preferences and goals.'

  description: [
    'I began with a competitive review of the top home care agencies in northern New Jersey, analyzing how they structured their websites, the tone of their messaging, and how effectively they reassured visitors navigating emotionally complex decisions.',
    'To complement that, I also conducted informal discovery through conversations with friends and family members who had recently gone through the process of finding home care. These stories underscored the urgency, emotional strain, and confusion that often accompany these decisions — and shaped how I approached tone, structure, and visual hierarchy.'

    '"When you are in a position where you need to find care for a loved one, it can be scary. It feels like you are trusting the person you hire with their life".',
  author: 'Mario G',
  takeaways: [
    'Most competitors used calming color palettes and soft, reassuring imagery',
    'Sites with clear FAQs and multiple contact options instilled more trust',
    'Visitors scanned for key info like insurance accepted, service areas, and 24/7 availability',
    'Overly modern or salesy designs felt cold and disconnected from user needs',
    "CTAs needed to be visible early and often — visitors shouldn't have to search to reach out"

    'Given the emotional nature of the service, I proposed a visual direction that combined calming blue tones with warm, uplifting imagery — portraying aging with dignity and vitality. While the client chose a more vibrant palette to stand out from competitors, they embraced the imagery concept fully, and it became a key visual theme across the site.',
    'Throughout the project, I worked to preserve core UX principles: structuring information to reduce cognitive load, emphasizing clarity of message, and ensuring large, tappable areas for mobile users. The goal was to keep the experience reassuring and intuitive, regardless of aesthetic preferences.'
