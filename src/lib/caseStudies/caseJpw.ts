    "With no content, brand identity, or online credibility in place, Jones Pressure Washing needed more than a visual facelift — they needed a foundation. Rather than rehash the limitations, I focused on building a site that could earn trust quickly through clarity, visual professionalism, and strong local signals. The challenge wasn't just to make something look good — it was to design a conversion engine for a brand without a track record."

    'I conducted a competitive review of pressure washing businesses across Northern New Jersey, analyzing how they structured content, implemented SEO, and approached layout across desktop and mobile. I also read through Google and Yelp reviews to understand what customers cared about most — from communication and pricing to before-and-after results.',
    'Because the client lacked testimonials and a visual portfolio, I explored how to build trust without traditional social proof. I supplemented my research by speaking with homeowners in my network to better understand how they choose service providers. These informal conversations revealed a strong reliance on first impressions, location visibility, and quick clarity about services and pricing.'
